# 3. similar to 2) but uses more epochs
This was the third attempt. This used almost the same code as in the second attempt but with some small changes to try to achieve a higher accuracy. This script was also supposed to just use 10% of the dataset, however later it was realized that this script actually only used 10% of 10%, so in total just 1% of the overall dataset. This mistake was corrected in the next script.
